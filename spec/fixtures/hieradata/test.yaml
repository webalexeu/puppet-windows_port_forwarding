# This allows you to acceptance test the _global_ hierarchy. Usually this is not
# what you want- for in-module data, just look at `/hiera.yaml` and `/data`
#
# There may be edge cases where this is useful - don't forget double check that
# * `/spec/fixtures/hiera.yaml`
# * `/spec/fixtures/hieradata/*`
# Have really made it to git. They are often excluded via `.gitignore`
